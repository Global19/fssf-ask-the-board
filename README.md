# Ask F# Software Foundation Board of Trustees

The purpose of this project is to request your comments, ideas and proposals on what should be addressed by the F# Software Foundation Board of Trustees.

To add your comment, idea, question or proposal, please, create a [new issue](https://github.com/fsharp/fssf-ask-the-board/issues/new). We encourage you to add as many details as possible. New issues are welcomed at any time.

Issues will be addressed by the Board by replying to the submitted issue with the response, or the reference to meeting notes, in case they reference and address the submitted item.

Due to time limitations, some of the submitted items might not be discussed during the closest Board meeting. In that case, the Board might put them on one of the future meeting's agenda and the submitter will be notified of the fact. The Board might also decide to review certain items outside of the monthly meeting via other communication channels, and will do their best in providing timely answers.

You are welcome to upvote/emoji existing issues to show your interest and support!
